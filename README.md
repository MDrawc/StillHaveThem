## General info
The design goal for [ StillHaveThem ](https://www.stillhavethem.com) was to make service that provides clean, distraction-free space for user and his games. Place where your games are in the spotlight and essential tools are easily available without the need to navigate through many subpages.

I built this project to improve my web development skills and keep track of my video game collection.
